# Temporal Pathways to Learning: How Learning Emerges in an Open-ended Collaborative Activity

We employ a multimodal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methodology
to investigate the temporal learning processes of two types of learners that have
learning gains and a type that does not have learning gains in an open-ended
collaborative learning activity.   
We make use of our open-source [dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5576058). We consider log data, speech behavior, affective
states and gaze patterns for each team for time windows of 10 seconds in a non-incremental format.

## Installation
The libraries we use for this methodology are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Structure

- `src` : contains an analysis notebook for each of the learner types.
- `results` : contains the reference result notebooks mentioned in the paper.
